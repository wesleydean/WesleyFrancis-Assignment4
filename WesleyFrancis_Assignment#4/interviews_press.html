					<h4 class="highlight-blue">By: Cameron Macdonald</h4>
					<h4 class="introduction">Five years ago, Jan Jelinek stitched together microscopic samples of soul and jazz music, and looped them to flow like a bloodstream on his landmark album, Loop-finding Jazz Records. The post-techno pioneer’s touch has also sang as microhouse in the form of Farben and as droning ambience under the name Gramm. Last year, Jelinek recorded under his own name again and explored his native Germany’s krautrock heritage in the psychedelic masterwork, Kosmischer Pitch. </h4>

					<h4 class="introduction">Jelinek toured the record this spring with a live band of guitarist Andrew Pekler and drummer Hanno Leichmann. Stylus caught up with Jelinek during his San Francisco tour stop a few days before he performed at the Mutek Festival in Montreal. </h4>
				</div>

				<div class="QA-box">
					<p class="question">What are you performing tonight? I understand that you’re working with a live band. </p>
					<p class="answer">We’ll try to represent only two or three tracks from the last album. It’ll mostly be improvised with new stuff. There are some loops that we prepared before but we drift into improvisation—I think that it’s 60 percent improvising. </p>
				</div>

				<div class="QA-box">
					<p class="question">Is the live setup similar to how (Australian jazz band) Triosk took your loops and jammed with them? Do you play your loops as a foundation for the band?</p>
					<p class="answer">Yes, but I respond to them as well. I have a synthesizer and I have an instrument called the Hohner Guitaret, it’s comparable to an African thumb piano. I can play some strange instruments as well. I can respond even if my main focus will be on the computer. </p>
				</div>

				<div class="QA-box">
					<p class="question">Has the band worked well so far? </p>
					<p class="answer">Yeah, it’s been good. Sometimes, it’s been a little chaotic but, so far, we’ve always had fun and I think it went well for the audience. It seems that the audience liked it. </p>
				</div>

				<div class="QA-box">
					<p class="question">Given that so music of your music is built on looped samples, what do you have to say is the power of the loop in electronic music?</p>
					<p class="answer">I really like repetitive music and the way I produce is that I start with a loop. I think that loop-oriented music is such a strong thing because it doesn’t have parameters like time. It’s a kind of anti-music in that way. Repetitive, loop-oriented music doesn’t need virtuosity, it’s actually anti-virtuosity. Loop-oriented music is against all parameters which describe music in a traditional way. When you are producing it, it is like meditating. While you are listening to the same loop for hours, you are starting to hallucinate, and you’re listening to the overtones, and starting to imagine elements that are not actually in the track. That’s what I like about loop music. </p>
				</div>

				<div class="QA-box">
					<p class="question">As you mention the meditative and hallucinatory qualities of your work, I have to say that many of your rhythms sound very mechanical and yet, there is also a ghostly drone that hovers above that rhythm. I hear that in tracks like “St. Mortiz” and “Moire (Strings).” Is that the way your music usually turns out to be or is it inspired by something else? </p>
					<p class="answer">When I start to produce, I don’t have a real intention of what something should sound like. Every piece of mine is (created) by the process of the interaction of the computer and me. Of course, there are influences, but I’m not a musician. Everything is focused on processing the sample sources, so I don’t know which direction it will go when I start with a sample. </p>
				</div>

				<div class="QA-box">
					<p class="question">How did you get into producing loop music? Was it inspired by the soul and jazz music you were listening to? </p>
					<p class="answer">Not jazz music, it’s actually the opposite. When I’m listening to music, I’m very sound-oriented. It’s not like I recognize the saxophone players who are playing, I’m oriented in how it sounds. When I’m listening to jazz music, I’m not interested in the parameters that describe jazz-like virtuosity. I like the jazz records from the 60’s and 70’s because of the sound and how they are recorded. I wouldn’t say that I’m a huge fan of jazz music, I’m a fan of the sound of the genre.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="QA-box">
					<p class="question">Given that you live and work in Berlin, I often see that city as a clash between the very modern and the very old, decaying Eastern Bloc past. I see that image while listening to your music a lot, where it’s very futuristic but it’s also worn by time. </p>
					<p class="answer">That’s a good interpretation, but I don’t have images or pictures when I’m producing. Of course, sometimes when you’re producing you think it sounds like blah, blah, whatever. But I’m not really visual-oriented. </p>
				</div>

					
				<div class="QA-box">
					<p class="question">What do you want to convey to listeners with your music? </p>
					<p class="answer">(Pauses) Music has to be very functionalized. Music doesn’t need any content, but it has to work as an ambience. My music was focused on that concept. I was also tired of authorship in rock music. It changed a bit during the years. Actually, when I’m producing music there is no message. I don’t have lyrics, it’s more about sound. When you think about sound, it’s not that you want to give people a message. But I’m not sure, I’ve never thought about that, to be honest. </p>
				</div>

				<div class="QA-box">
					<p class="question">When I listen to your minimalist work, it has that meditative quality.</p>
					<p class="answer">Loop-oriented music is actually not an entertaining music. The listeners’ own cognition causes them to listen (sharper) and recognize overtones after hearing the same loop for 20 minutes. For instance, when you are listening to a minimalist composition at a concert, everyone is listening to it in a different way and everyone is recognizing something different. One (person) is recognizing overtones, resonances, or whatever, and the other person is listening to the drones. It’s more focused on (personal) cognition than entertainment. </p>
				</div>

				<div class="QA-box">
					<p class="question">In Farben, what interested you in breaking down samples and creating funk music out of them? </p>
					<p class="answer">The sample sources are very connected to club music. As you asked me (earlier), I was into De La Soul, their first record was working with those kind of samples as well. I tried to put the sample source in a different context. In general, when you are listening to a soul sample, it’s obviously pop or R&and;B, and I tried something different. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="QA-box">
					<p class="question">Is there any music that you are now really getting into? </p>
					<p class="answer">Right now, in the States, I’m looking for exotica stuff. The plan is to make a record with those sample sources and also play the instruments that were used on those records as well.</p>
